# ToDoListClientUI

This is a client application for my to do list rest api. 

It's been built with java and javascript and by that i mean:
  - the client runs on spring boot and relies on spring security to authenticate requests.
  - it has a self-segned certificate to secure the http connection between the api and itself
  - the client UI's been created with jquery for easier DOM tree manipulation and html element accessing
  - the requests to the api are done with ajax
  - the api response is rendered with Mustache.js
  - everything is custom created
  
  I have spent a fair share amount of time to single handedly write this and i know it is far from perfect,
  but i sure am proud to write this all all by myself. No templates. No pussy shit. All raw.
